# Online Learning Management System 

## 📖 Overview  
The Online Learning Management System (OLMS) is a web-based platform built using ASP.NET Web Forms (3-tier architecture) to manage online courses, students, trainers, quizzes, and enrollments.
It provides a complete learning ecosystem where Admins can manage courses & users, Trainers can create quizzes/materials, and Students can enroll in courses, take quizzes, and track progress.

This project was developed step-by-step to simulate a real-world enterprise application and demonstrate concepts of ASP.NET Web Forms, ADO.NET, stored procedures, authentication, and security.

## 🎓 Project Plan:
```
step-1: Project & environment setup (Solution + Projects, references)
step-2: Database creation & seed data.
step-3: Adding model classes for each tables. (POCO classes)
step-4: DAL: DbHelper + (Interface & Repository) skeletons.
step-5: BLL: Services, Authentication, Business rules.
step-6: UI: MasterPage + Register/Login + course listing (responsive Bootstrap).
step-7: Admin pages: manage courses (CRUD), secure by role.
step-8: Advanced: file storage, quiz engine, AJAX partial updates, charts, reports, email notifications.
step-9: Deploy to IIS and secure (production checklist).

## ▶️ How to run the project ?
1️⃣ Clone the Repository - <b>git clone https://github.com/Sachin-4-5/Online_Learning_Management_System.git</b> <br />
2️⃣ Execute the provided SQL script to create OLMSDB with necessary tables and seed data. <br>
3️⃣ Open OnlineLearningManagementSystem.sln in Visual Studio (recommended version: 2017 or later). <br />
4️⃣ Update the connection string in web.config with your SQL Server instance details and authentication mode. <br />
5️⃣ Set the UI project as the startup project. <br >
6️⃣ Build the entire solution to restore DLL references. <br />
7️⃣ Publish the OLMS.UI project to a local folder (e.g., C:\inetpub\wwwroot\OnlineLearningManagementSystem). <br />
8️⃣ Press F5 or click Start to run the application through VS built-in IIS Server. <b>or</b> <br />
9️⃣ IIS Setup: <br />
    🔹Create a new site in IIS pointing to the published folder. <br />
    🔹Assign an application pool with .NET CLR Version v4.0 and set identity with appropriate DB access. <br />
    🔹Set folder permissions for the app pool identity. <br />
🔟 Access the site via your configured URL and port.
